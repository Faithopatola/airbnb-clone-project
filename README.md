# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive backend-focused initiative to build a robust, secure, and scalable booking platform similar to Airbnb. This project simulates the architecture of real-world applications and focuses on backend development using modern tools and best practices in software engineering.

## Goals

- Learn how to structure and manage a professional backend repository.
- Deepen understanding of backend architecture using Django and MySQL.
- Design and implement secure RESTful and GraphQL APIs.
- Build and document a relational database schema.
- Automate development and deployment with CI/CD pipelines.
- Collaborate effectively using GitHub and Markdown documentation.

## Team Roles

### Backend Developer
Responsible for designing and building backend functionalities, including RESTful or GraphQL APIs, user authentication, business logic, and third-party integrations.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs the database schema, manages relationships and indexes, and ensures data integrity and performance tuning.

### DevOps Engineer
Handles the CI/CD pipeline setup, containerization with Docker, versioning, and deployment workflows using GitHub Actions or similar tools.

### Security Engineer
Implements key security practices like authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and input validation to ensure secure API usage.

### Technical Writer
Produces clear, structured documentation including project overviews, technical details, API documentation, and deployment guides.

## Technology Stack

| Technology     | Purpose                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Django**     | High-level Python framework for building backend APIs and web logic     |
| **MySQL**      | Relational database system for structured storage of platform data      |
| **GraphQL**    | API query language to retrieve and manipulate nested data efficiently   |
| **Docker**     | Containerization tool to ensure consistency across development environments |
| **GitHub Actions** | Automation tool to manage CI/CD workflows like testing and deployment   |

## Database Design

### Entities & Key Fields:

1. **User**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `email`
   - `password_hash`

2. **Property**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `title`
   - `location`
   - `host_id` (Foreign Key to User)

3. **Booking**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `user_id` (Foreign Key)
   - `property_id` (Foreign Key)
   - `check_in`
   - `check_out`

4. **Review**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `booking_id` (Foreign Key)
   - `rating`
   - `comment`

5. **Payment**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `booking_id` (Foreign Key)
   - `amount`
   - `payment_status`

### Relationships:

- A **User** can host multiple **Properties**.
- A **Property** can have multiple **Bookings**.
- A **Booking** is linked to a **User**, a **Property**, a **Review**, and a **Payment**.
- A **Review** is submitted after a **Booking**.
- A **Payment** corresponds to a **Booking**.

## Feature Breakdown

### üßë User Management
Handles secure registration, login, password management, and profile editing for both guests and hosts.

### üè° Property Management
Allows hosts to list new properties, update descriptions, set prices and availability, and remove listings.

### üìÖ Booking System
Enables guests to book available properties, check availability, modify or cancel bookings based on host rules.

### ‚≠ê Reviews & Ratings
After a completed stay, guests can leave reviews for properties. These ratings influence property visibility.

### üí≥ Payment Integration
Processes secure transactions for property bookings, handles failed payments, and tracks payment history.

---

## API Security

### Key Measures:

- **Authentication**: Uses JWT tokens to validate user identity and maintain secure sessions.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access ensures only hosts can modify properties and only users can book.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and abuse of API endpoints.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization**: Prevents SQL injection, XSS, and other common vulnerabilities.
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Ensures all communications are encrypted during transit.

### Importance:
- Protects sensitive user data.
- Prevents unauthorized access to booking and payment systems.
- Maintains trust and reliability across all user interactions.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

**Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment** (CI/CD) is a development practice that allows code changes to be automatically tested and deployed to production or staging environments.

### Benefits:

- Reduces human errors in deployment.
- Speeds up feature delivery.
- Ensures a consistent development workflow.

### Tools Used:

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates linting, unit testing, and deployment upon pushing to main branches.
- **Docker**: Standardizes the application environment for testing and production.
- **Optional Deployment Platforms**: Heroku, Render, or AWS for hosting the backend services.

## Conclusion

This Airbnb Clone backend project is more than just a simulation‚Äîit's a comprehensive exercise in applying full-stack backend development principles in a real-world environment. It strengthens core skills in architecture, security, team collaboration, and DevOps, forming a solid foundation for scalable, maintainable software systems.
